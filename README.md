A new Flutter project.

## About our Flutter Application

Our app serves as a vital lifeline for the visually impaired and senior citizens

This app creates a customized route for you. Here is how it works:

 - Your Voice becomes the navigator. 
 - Simply speak, and our Intelligent Voice Assistant, a fusion of speech to text and text to speech technology, effortlessly comprehends your instructions. 
 - First, we pinpoint your curent location - where you stand at the moment.
 - The voice assistant captures your location and sends it as a node to our backend system, which is a network of interconnected nodes. 
 - The backend is designed as a graph, comprising of these nodes, each representing a possible destination within the environment. 
 - Our app generates a path from your current node to your chosen destination node, creating a route for you.
 - By utilizing step count data, we calculate the exact distance you've covered, ensuring that the instructions you receive are accurate and precise.
 - Our app also highlights the essential amenities that come along the way like restrooms, etc.

Join us in this movement, and together, we will illuminate a path where every destination is not only accessible but well within your grasp.
