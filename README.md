## About Flutter Application

Our App creates a customized route for you. 

Our App offers a lifeline to the Visually Impaired and Senior Citizens.

 - Your Voice becomes the navigator. 
 - Simply speak, and our Intelligent Vpice Assitant, a fusion of speech to text and text to speech technology, listens your command effortlessly. 
 - First, we pinpoint your starting point-where you stand at this moment.
 - Your voice assitant captures your location and sends it aas a node to our backend system, network of interconnected nodes. 
 - Our backend, designed as a graph, comprises these nodes, each representing a possible destination within the environment. 
 - Our app generates a path from your current node to your chosen destination node, creating a route for you.
 - Using step count we calculate the distance you have traveled, highlighting essential amenities along the way. 

Join our moment, together we'll illuminate a path where every destination is within reach.
